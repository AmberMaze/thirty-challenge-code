## ðŸ“Œ Core Guidelines for AI Agents

- Always **assume Node 20**, ESM only â€” avoid `require`, use top-level `import`.
    
- Project uses **React 18** with functional components and hooks.
    
- CSS is **Tailwind 3.5** â€” never suggest inline styles or styled-components.
    
- Animations use **Framer Motion 12**.
    
- State management is **React context** for now. No Redux.
    
- Realtime and DB use **Supabase JS SDK v2.19.0**.
    
- MVP must remain **< 200kB JS** â€” avoid bloated libraries.
    
- All logic should be **client-side only** unless explicitly asked otherwise.

## ðŸ›‘ Avoid Unless Explicitly Asked

- No Redux/MobX/Recoil suggestions.
    
- No deprecated React patterns (`useHistory`, `UNSAFE_`, etc.).
    
- Donâ€™t suggest Tailwind hacks from v1/v2 era.

- Donâ€™t use beta packages or "next" releases.
    
- Donâ€™t overwrite `.env` or suggest secrets hardcoding.

## ðŸ“š How to Learn from This Repo

You can analyze:

1. Any file in the repo for syntax, imports, function usage.
    
2. `PROJECT_OVERVIEW.md` to understand the structure and version choices.
    
3. `QUIZ_STRUCTURE.md` to understand the game logic and quiz segments.
    
4. GitHub issues (label: `needs-gpt`) to find prompts or request explanations.
    

---

## ðŸ§ª When Suggesting Codeâ€¦

- Return only compile-ready JSX or JS/TS (no pseudocode).
    
- Use the correct Tailwind class names â€” no `"text-sm text-gray"` junk.
    
- Stick to pinned versions from `PROJECT_OVERVIEW.md`.
    
- Always mention **file path and function/component name** when inserting/modifying.

## ðŸ§  Default Mental Model for You

You are acting like a **senior dev in a two-person React team**. The other dev is human (Tareq), sometimes on mobile, sometimes on desktop. Assume intermediate knowledge: donâ€™t dumb down, but **donâ€™t over-assume experience** in debugging frameworks or obscure tools either.

If unsure, **link to docs** or **leave comments in code**.
